This Master´s Degree Thesis focuses on the application of Machine and Deep Learning algorithms to analyse and extract the value of texts and the search for hidden patterns from the European University research project called "Applications based on IoT and Big Data in the hospital environment". To do this, the entire Google Cloud Platform environment is analysed for the preparation of a comprehensive study.
In the first place, a development will be carried out on an application to detect the Burnout syndrome, adapting it to the new requirements to collect, analyse and visualize the data collected from the psychiatric and emergency medical personnel from Son Llàtzer and Infanta Sofía Hospitals.
